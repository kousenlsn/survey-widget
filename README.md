## survey-widget
*Lightweight simple (predefined) survey pop-up component as a widget / lib.*

### Motivation :running:

- Knowledge test app.

### Features :mag_right:

- Add as a single script to any html page;
- Add custom callback events between the survey step to do anything with the selected data;
- "Continue where you stopped" feature based on initial data.

### Run :construction_worker:

##### Building as a widget:
1. ``npm install``Â 
2. ``npm build``
3. Use results at ./dist/

##### Building as a lib (ESM module):
1. ``npm install``
2. ``npm build:es``
3. Use results at ./dist/es/

##### Use as a widget:
1. Add to any ``.html`` file inside a ``<script>`` tag:
  ```
    <script src="./dist/survey-widget.js"></script>
  ```
2. Instanciate the widget:
  ```
    <script type="module">
      SurveyWidget.surveyWidget(
        // optional target selector
        // optional configs
      )
    </script>
  ```
